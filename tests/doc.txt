Install
-------
npm install -g protractor
webdriver-manager update
install chrome

Run
---
protractor conf.js

Notes:
- `ionic serve --nobrowser` must be launched to serve the app...
- conf.js is in [BASEDIR]/tests/
- if you get the following error "undefined:119", try `n stable`

To play everything, just launch run.sh from top directory
(screen is required as ionic serve require STDIN)
